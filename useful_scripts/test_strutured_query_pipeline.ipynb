Friedman (1999). Stochastic Gradient Boosting\\n\\nThe dataset names are coded as \"fri_colinearintydegree_samplenumber_featurenumber\".\\n\\nFriedman is the one of the most used functions for data generation (Friedman, 1999). Friedman functions include both linear and non-linear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise (e) is added to the output. The Friedman function is as follows: \\n\\ny=10*sin(pi*x1*x2)+20*(x3-0.5)^2=10*X4+5*X5+e\\n\\nIn the original Friedman function, there are 5 features for input. To measure the effects of non-related features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. However, to measure the algorithm\\'s robustness to the colinearity, the datasets are generated with 5 different colinearity degrees. The colinearity degrees is the number of features depending on other features. \\n\\nThe generated Friedman dataset\\'s parameters and values are given below: \\nThe number of features: 5 10 25 50 100 (only the first 5 features are related to the output.
