It does not emit or absorb light, but gravity is still affected by it.\n\n- Black holes: Large dense objects where the gravitational pull is so strong even light can't escape. They can be produced by supernovae explosions, stellar collisions, or the collapse of massive stars.\n\n- Cosmic inflation: A period in the early universe after its big bang that caused the expansion to accelerate, allowing galaxies to form and eventually reach their current state.",
